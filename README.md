# projeto-cordel
 A page featuring cordel literature (a Brazilian literary genre), a parallax effect, and responsiveness. This was created during Chapter 20 of the HTML5 and CSS3 course by Professor Gustavo Guanabara. I would like to thank Professor Gustavo Guanabara.

Here is the link to access the website: https://sodiuz.github.io/projeto-cordel/ The site is still not finished! Many things may change over time.
